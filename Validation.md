In regression, our model takes the shape $t = f(x | w)$. We have discussed (at some length now) how to select the best $w$ to optimise the model. But how do we pick $f$?

To understand this, we need to understand what loss is. When we came across it earlier, it was introduced as 'a measure of how good the model is'


Loss $\mathcal{L}$ represents 

So far, we have discussed how to optimise a model - how to find the best $w$. But remeber, our model takes the shape $t = f(x | w)$. W
